# Unittests and Integration Tests

# Objectives:
- The difference between unit and integration tests.
- Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures

# mocking
- replacing real objects with mock objects to isolate behavior of unit being tested
# Parameterization
- Allows you to run same test with different sets of inputs, covering multiple scenarios with a single test function
# Fixtures
- Set up and tear down test environments to ensure a consistent state before and after tests
